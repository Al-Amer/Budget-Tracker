Project Guidelines and Requirements


Users will be able to add and remove income or expense transactions, store them as daily JSON files,
and generate rich date-range reports with LINQ, all from a simple terminal menu. Along the way you’ll
wrestle with file I/O, serialisation, custom events, and bullet-proof error handling, giving you a
rock-solid foundation for real-world .NET utilities.
